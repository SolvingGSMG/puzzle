The `GSMG 5 BTC Puzzle Challenge` was launched in 2019 by the team behind [GSMG.io](https://gsmg.io), a Bitcoin trading bot, offering a prize of 5 BTC — valued at $10,000 at the time. The creator(s) of the puzzle are early Bitcoin adopters with deep knowledge of cryptography and the core technologies that power Bitcoin. Despite six years of effort from hundreds of dedicated solvers, the puzzle remains unsolved.

In fact, all the solved portions of the puzzle were solved by 2021, and there has been no 'real' progress since. Despite this uncomfortable reality—four years without any breakthroughs—community interest and activity around solving the puzzle remain high!


# Introduction 🌀🐇

The community’s approach largely revolves around open-ended brainstorming—constantly introducing new theories, interpretations, and layers of complexity to the puzzle. While this kind of thinking is valuable, most of these ideas don’t come with any real, testable data. Just like in cryptography, even the best ideas need to be applied in a practical way—otherwise, they don’t lead to real progress.

This kind of approach aligns perfectly with the phrase `follow the white rabbit`. It captures the essence of diving deep into endless theories, chasing intriguing but often unproven ideas, and venturing further down the rabbit hole without a clear path forward. While this fuels curiosity, keeps the community engaged, and is undeniably fun, it can also create more confusion than clarity if not grounded in practical testing. And we are — after all — trying to get our hands on some `BITCOINS`.

We have now reached a point where we’ve decided to share everything with the public. Of course, we still want the prize ourselves — but what matters most is that the puzzle gets solved, sooner rather than later.


# Puzzlers 🌱🧮

The purpose of this GitHub repository is to bring people together to think, collaborate, and work.
We welcome anyone to reach out, share ideas, and help one another.

We've returned to this puzzle on and off for several years and poured thousands of hours into it. And although it feels like shit most days working on it, enough is enough — we are ready to commit every waking hour to this challenge, once and for all. While Bitcoin continues its march to conquer the world, what better way to spend our time than by possibly getting our hands on even more of it — while learning new things along the way?

If you have interesting theories, facts, tested ideas, or any valuable information — especially things that challenge or discredit existing approaches — that could benefit the solvers of this puzzle, please share them with us!
