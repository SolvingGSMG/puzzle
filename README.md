The `GSMG 5 BTC Puzzle Challenge` was launched in 2019, offering a prize of 5 BTC—valued at $10,000 at the time. The creator(s) behind the puzzle are early Bitcoin adopters with deep knowledge of cryptography and the fundamental technologies that power Bitcoin at its core. As of April 2025, the puzzle remains unsolved, despite six years of effort from hundreds of dedicated solvers.

In fact, all the solved portions of the puzzle were solved by 2021, and there has been no progress since. Despite this uncomfortable reality—four years without any breakthroughs—community interest and activity around solving the puzzle remain high!


# Introduction 🌀🐇

The community’s approach largely revolves around open-ended brainstorming—constantly introducing new theories, interpretations, and layers of complexity to the puzzle. While this kind of thinking is valuable, most of these ideas don’t come with any real, testable data. Just like in cryptography, even the best ideas need to be applied in a practical way—otherwise, they don’t lead to real progress.

This kind of approach aligns perfectly with the phrase `follow the white rabbit`. It captures the essence of diving deep into endless theories, chasing intriguing but often unproven ideas, and venturing further down the rabbit hole without a clear path forward. While it fuels curiosity and keeps the community engaged, it can also lead to more confusion than clarity if not grounded in practical testing.


# GSMG puzzlers pool 🌱🧮

The purpose of this GitHub repository is to bring people together to think and work on the puzzle as a team. Just like how Bitcoin uses BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) to organize ideas and changes, we want to create a simple system that helps everyone collaborate in a clear and structured way. The goal is to stay focused, work towards the same objective, and follow the same process.

The benefit of working together like this—as a group or a “pool”—is that over time, new ideas will become easier to evaluate. Each idea will either support the current way of thinking, or reveal flaws in it and point us in a new direction. This helps us move forward more efficiently by constantly testing and refining our approach.

Personally, I’ve probably spent close to 1,000 hours trying to solve this puzzle. I’ll admit—much of that time was spent chasing vague hints and going in circles. Looking back, a big part of that was due to not following any clear framework or structured approach. That’s exactly why I’m suggesting we try a more organized method now.
