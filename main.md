# ðŸ“œ A Structured Puzzle-Solving Framework


### ðŸ§  Why This Framework?

Right now, most solvers are working in isolation or chaos. This system gives us:

  * A shared map of whatâ€™s being worked on
  * Avoid repeating dead ends
  * The oportunity to build on other's ideas more easily
  * Tracking progress to avoid repeating the work of others
  * Quickly debunking or verifying theories as a collective


### ðŸ§© Core Components:

1) *Central Hypothesis Tracker*

   * We maintain a list of all current solving theories that have enough supporting evidenceâ€”meaning there's a reasonable indication that continuing down that path could lead to real progress on the puzzle.

   * Each theory gets its own subfolder or discussion thread for details and tracking progress.

2) *Idea Submission*

   * Anyone contributing a new idea uses a simple template:
       
         TITLE: 

            Summary  : A summary of the theory.

            Evidence : Hints, theories and other evidence that support the theory.

            Scope    : Specific work or tests needed to investigate it further.

   * Make a text file with your submission and post it in the telegram group for everyone to discuss

3) *Check-ins*
   
   Every week/month (or every X weeks/months), a summary is posted with:

            New ideas added

            Any tested/confirmed/rejected items

            Any shifts in the overall direction
